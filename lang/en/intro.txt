====== Word Import ======

This dialog allows you to import a Microsoft Word document into a DokuWiki page. The document is converted to DokuWiki syntax and can be edited afterwards.

If the page already exists, the imported content will create a new page revision. If the page does not exist, a new page will be created. Images contained in the Word document will be uploaded to the media manager.
